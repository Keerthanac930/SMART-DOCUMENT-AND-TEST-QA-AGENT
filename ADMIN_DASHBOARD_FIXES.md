# Admin Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Admin Routes**
- Created `AdminUsers.jsx` page for user management
- Created `AdminDocuments.jsx` page for document management
- Added routes in `App.jsx` for:
  - `/admin/users` - User management
  - `/admin/documents` - Document management

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints**
- Added `DELETE /api/admin/documents/{document_id}` endpoint in `admin.py`
- Document deletion now works properly for admins

### 3. **Sidebar Navigation**
- Updated `Sidebar.jsx` to support admin navigation
- Added admin-specific menu items:
  - Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
  - Create Test (`/admin/create-test`)
  - Users (`/admin/users`)
  - Documents (`/admin/documents`)
  - Scores (`/admin/scores`)
- Sidebar now switches between admin and student views based on `admin` prop

### 4. **Layout Component Updates**
- All admin pages now pass `admin={true}` to Layout component
- Layout component properly passes admin prop to Sidebar and Header

### 5. **Component Files Updated**

#### Frontend Files:
- `frontend_react/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Added admin prop
- `frontend_react/src/pages/AdminUsers.jsx` - New file for user management
- `frontend_react/src/pages/AdminDocuments.jsx` - New file for document management

## New Features

### Admin Users Page (`/admin/users`)
- View all users with search functionality
- View user details in modal
- Delete users (excluding admin accounts)
- Shows user statistics (tests taken, registration date)

### Admin Documents Page (`/admin/documents`)
- View all documents in the system
- Upload new documents
- Delete documents

- Search by document name or type
- Shows document statistics (pages, words, status)

## Navigation Flow

Admin users can now navigate:
1. **Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) - Main admin dashboard with stats
2. **Create Test** (`/admin/create-test`) - Create tests manually or with AI
3. **Users** (`/admin/users`) - Manage users
4. **Documents** (`/admin/documents`) - Manage documents
5. **Scores** (`/admin/scores`) - View student scores

All navigation is accessible via the sidebar when logged in as admin.
