# Frontend Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Tailwind CSS Not Loading
**Problem:** The React frontend was showing unstyled HTML without any of the beautiful glassmorphism effects, gradients, or Tailwind styles.

**Solution:** Created missing `postcss.config.js` file required for Tailwind CSS to work with Vite.

**File Created:**
- `frontend_react/postcss.config.js`

### 2. ✅ API Configuration Error
**Problem:** The `api.js` file was exporting just a URL string, but components were trying to use it as an axios instance (e.g., `api.post()`).

**Solution:** Updated `api.js` to export a properly configured axios instance with:
- Request interceptors for authentication tokens
- Response interceptors for error handling
- Automatic token refresh on 401 errors

**Files Updated:**
- `frontend_react/src/config/api.js`

### 3. ✅ AuthContext Import Error
**Problem:** AuthContext was importing the old `API_BASE_URL` string instead of the new axios instance.

**Solution:** Updated AuthContext to use the new `api` instance for all API calls.

**Files Updated:**
- `frontend_react/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

### 4. ✅ Registration Failure
**Problem:** Registration was failing due to incorrect API configuration and error handling.

**Solution:** Fixed API calls to use proper axios instance with correct error handling and token management.

## How to Test:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` in your browser
   - Clear cached images and files
   - OR do a hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

2. **Access the Application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (or whatever port Vite assigned)
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000

3. **Test Registration:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/signup
   - Fill in the form:
     - Username: test123
     - Email: test@example.com
     - Password: password123
     - Confirm Password: password123
     - Account Type: Student or Admin
   - Click "Create Account"
   - Should redirect to login after successful registration

4. **Test Login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/login
   - Enter your credentials
   - Should see the beautiful dashboard with all Tailwind styles

## What You Should See Now:

✨ **Beautiful UI with:**
- Glassmorphism effects (frosted glass look)
- Gradient backgrounds with animated orbs
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Perfectly centered forms
- Professional color scheme (blue & purple gradients)
- Responsive design

## If Styles Still Don't Load:

Run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Stop all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend_react

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

Then do a hard refresh in your browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## Servers Running:

- ✅ Backend FastAPI: http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Frontend React: http://localhost:3001 (check your terminal for the actual port)

Both servers should be running in the background!
