Ethics in Machine Learning

Ethics in machine learning is one of the most important aspects of AI development.
Machine learning models can unintentionally learn bias from data, resulting in unfair or harmful outcomes.

Developers must ensure:
- Transparency: Explain how models make decisions.
- Fairness: Avoid bias in training datasets.
- Privacy: Protect user data from misuse.
- Accountability: Clearly define who is responsible when models fail.

A well-governed ML system balances innovation with responsibility.
