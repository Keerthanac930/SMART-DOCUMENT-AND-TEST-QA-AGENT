    Introduction to Machine Learning
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
    developing systems that can learn from data. These systems improve their 
    performance on tasks through experience, without being explicitly programmed.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
    2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
    3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error
    
    Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, 
    recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
